# Android Basics with Compose Learning Journey

This repository documents my hands-on learning experience with Android Basics with Compose, the official course from developer.android.com. My goal is to build a strong foundation in modern Android app development using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.

I started this course on May 15, 2025, diving into the fundamentals of Kotlin and the core concepts of Jetpack Compose. I'm actively building the tutorial applications provided in the course to solidify my understanding through practical application. I aim to complete this comprehensive course by May 31, 2025.

--------------------Key Concepts I'm Learning (and Applying)---------------------

As I progress through the course, I'm focusing on understanding and implementing:

---------------------------------Why Jetpack Compose-------------------------------

I'm focusing on Compose as it's the recommended, modern toolkit for building native Android UIs. It significantly simplifies and accelerates UI development, making it an essential skill for current and future Android roles.

1.  Deepen my understanding of Android Architecture Components.
2.  Explore advanced Compose topics and animations.
3.  Start building my own original Android applications.
